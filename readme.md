### Array sort in ASCII-table symbol code order ported on PHP.

For what? Just for ~~lulz~~ scientific purposes.

When I'm learn C/C++ I'm wrote this for studying in 2010 year.

Just now I accidentally stumble on this sort algorithm and there was a desire to port him into PHP.
At sametime show how this languages are similar.

In 2_2_9.cpp file you can find my practical work on studying C/C++.
